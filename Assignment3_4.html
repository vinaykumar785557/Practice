       <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). European law calls these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:
 preventing risk and fraud
        answering questions or providing other types of support
        helping merchants find and use apps through our app store
        providing and improving our products and services
        providing reporting and analytics
        testing out features or additional services
        assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications
        We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.
        
        One of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like “machine learning” (European law refers to this as “automated decision-making”) to help us improve our services. When we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don’t have significant privacy implications (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store).</P>
      
       <h3>Copyright</h3>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>What is copyright and what does it protect?
        In most countries, copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship. Typically, if you create an original work, you have a copyright from the moment you create it.
        
        Copyright covers a wide variety of types of works, including:
        
        Visual or audiovisual works: videos, movies, TV shows and broadcasts, video games, paintings, photographs
        Audio works: songs, musical compositions, sound recordings, spoken word recordings
        Written works: books, plays, manuscripts, articles, musical scores
        Please note, only an original work is eligible for copyright protection. To be original enough for copyright protection, a work needs to be created by the author themselves and have some minimal amount of creativity.
        
        Generally, names, titles, slogans or short phrases aren't considered to be original enough to qualify for copyright protection. For example, the symbol “+” is likely not subject to copyright, but a painting full of shapes and colors arranged in a unique pattern is likely protected by copyright.
        
        Copyright generally doesn’t protect facts or ideas, but it may protect the original words or images that express a fact or idea. This means that you may be able to express the same idea or fact as another author, as long as you don’t copy that author’s way of expressing that idea or fact. For example, a playwright may not be able to copyright the idea of a man waking up to repeat the same day over and over again, but the script for a play or movie expressing that idea could be subject to copyright.</P>
